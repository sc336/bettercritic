# bettercritic

This project is an analysis of MetaCritic vs sales data.  Due to space constraints, I've not uploaded a fair amount of the raw data, some of which was produced in one-off analysis sessions in ipython, which are not recorded here.

In order to run this code, you'll need pyplot, pandas, and numpy.  You'll need BeautifulSoup 4 for the scraping part.
